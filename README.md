Creates an inventory of a Citrix XenDesktop 7.8+ Site using Microsoft PowerShell, Word, 
	plain text, or HTML.
	
	This Script requires at least PowerShell version 3 but runs best in version 5.

	Word is NOT needed to run the script. This script will output in Text and HTML.
	
	You do NOT have to run this script on a Controller. This script was developed and run 
	from a Windows 10 VM.
	
	You can run this script remotely using the â€“AdminAddress (AA) parameter.
	
	This script supports versions of XenApp/XenDesktop starting with 7.8.
	
	NOTE: The account used to run this script must have at least Read access to the SQL

	complete and can generate an extremely long report.

	complete and can generate an extremely long report.
